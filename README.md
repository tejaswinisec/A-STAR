<h1>ExpNo 4 : Implement A* search algorithm for a Graph</h1> 
<h3>Name: TEJASWINI P D </h3>
<h3>Register Number: 212224060278     </h3>
<H3>Aim:</H3>
<p>To Implement A* Search algorithm for a Graph using Python 3.</p>
<H3>Algorithm:</H3>

1.  Initialize the open list
2.  Initialize the closed list
    put the starting node on the open 
    list (you can leave its f at zero)

3.  while the open list is not empty
    a) find the node with the least f on 
       the open list, call it "q"

    b) pop q off the open list
  
    c) generate q's 8 successors and set their 
       parents to q
   
    d) for each successor
        i) if successor is the goal, stop search
        
    ii) else, compute both g and h for successor
          successor.g = q.g + distance between 
                              successor and q
          successor.h = distance from goal to 
          successor (This can be done using many 
          ways, we will discuss three heuristics- 
          Manhattan, Diagonal and Euclidean 
          Heuristics)
          
      successor.f = successor.g + successor.h

     iii) if a node with the same position as 
            successor is in the OPEN list which has a 
           lower f than successor, skip this successor
     iV) if a node with the same position as 
            successor  is in the CLOSED list which has
            a lower f than successor, skip this successor
            otherwise, add  the node to the open list
end (for loop)
  
    e) push q on the closed list
    end (while loop)

    parent = {start: None}
    g_cost = {start: 0}
    closed_list = set()

    while open_list:
        f, current = heapq.heappop(open_list)

        if current == goal:
            # Build final path
            path = []
            while current is not None:
                path.append(current)
                current = parent[current]
            return path[::-1]

        closed_list.add(current)

        for neighbor, cost in graph[current]:
            temp_g = g_cost[current] + cost
            temp_f = temp_g + heuristics[neighbor]

            # If neighbor already in closed with better f -> skip
            if neighbor in closed_list and temp_f >= g_cost.get(neighbor, float('inf')):
                continue

            # If better path found -> update
            if temp_f < g_cost.get(neighbor, float('inf')):
                parent[neighbor] = current
                g_cost[neighbor] = temp_g
                heapq.heappush(open_list, (temp_f, neighbor))
